# BlackJack

# about
This is a very simple blackjack game written in Java that is intended
to help me become more familiar with GitHub and best coding practices.

# current features
The program currently runs in the console accepting "hit" or "stand"
as input during the player's turn and "yes" or "no" after the round.
The dealer hits until they have at least 17 points, after which the player
conducts their turn. Both the dealer and the player can go bust, resulting
in a win for whatever party is not disqualified. After the round, a message
is displayed based on the players' scores and whether they are bust.
